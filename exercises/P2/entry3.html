        <h1>Entry 3: Triangulation & 3D Point Visualization</h1>

        <h2>ðŸ”¼ Triangulation & 3D Point Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            Everything is now ready to compute the 3D position of the previously matched points.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this, I use the <code>HAL.backproject()</code> function to convert the 2D coordinates into backprojection rays from each camera. 
            Then, I take the midpoint between the two rays to estimate the actual position of the point in 3D space.
        </p>

        <p>
            Afterward, the resulting 3D point is transformed into the 3D viewer's coordinate system using <code>HAL.project3DScene()</code>. 
            To assign each point its real color, I compute the average color of the corresponding pixels in both images.
        </p>

        <p>
            This helps reduce minor camera differences and results in a more natural visualization.
            I concatenate the 3D point with its color values <code>[r, g, b]</code> to form a 6-element list, and use 
            <code>GUI.ShowNewPoints()</code> to display the colored point in the viewer.
        </p>

        <p>
            During this step, I encountered an error when visualizing the points in the 3D viewer. Specifically, 
            <code>GUI.ShowNewPoints()</code> threw a <code>ValueError</code> with the message 
            <em>"the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous"</em>.
            This issue was caused by passing NumPy arrays directly instead of converting them to lists.
            Once I forced both the 3D point coordinates and their color to be lists, the first triangulated points displayed successfully:
        </p>

        <h2>ðŸ§  Testing Triangulation with More Points</h2>
        <p>
            When testing the triangulation on a larger set of points, the 3D viewer began to show a partial reconstruction of the scene. 
            However, two clear issues became immediately visible:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                The image appears inverted:
                <img src="images/img6.png" alt="Scene inverted" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px;">
            </li>
            <li>
                No depth is present: The z value is always the same.
                <img src="images/img7.png" alt="No depth in triangulated scene" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px;">
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>ðŸš§ Correct 3D Point Triangulation</h2>
        <p>
            By printing the output from my triangulation function, I confirmed that something was going wrong. 
            As shown in the previous image, the <code>z</code> coordinate was always 1. Something was clearly broken.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the initial implementation, the 3D point was estimated by averaging the outputs from <code>HAL.backproject()</code> 
            from both cameras. This approach ignored the actual position of the cameras and assumed both rays originated from the same point, 
            which is incorrect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, <code>HAL.backproject()</code> returns a 3D point that lies along a ray, but doesnâ€™t define the entire ray path. 
            Without knowing the rayâ€™s origin (the camera position), proper triangulation isn't possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            To solve this, I changed my strategy, making use of the available functions and applying stereo ray geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, I obtained the actual position of each camera using <code>HAL.getCameraPosition()</code>, which gives the ray's origin.
            Then, I transformed each image point into optical coordinates using <code>HAL.graphicToOptical()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, I applied <code>HAL.backproject()</code> to the optical point to get a 3D point in the ray's direction.
            I then computed the direction vector by subtracting the camera position from this point â€” 
            thus defining the full ray (origin + direction).
        </p>

        <p>
            With the two rays defined, I solved for their intersection by computing the closest points on each line and averaging them 
            if they donâ€™t intersect exactly. With this new method, the resulting points now show proper depth.
        </p>
