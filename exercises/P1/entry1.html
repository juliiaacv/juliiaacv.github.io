        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Entry 1: System Initialization & Line Detection</h1>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">ðŸš€ Initialization</h2>
        <p>
            First, it is important to start with a simple and basic test to observe how the system works and 
            to get familiar with the environment and the conditions in which we will be working. 
            For this reason, I started the car in the <strong>Simple Circuit</strong> at a very low and constant 
            linear speed, with no rotational speed.
        </p>
        <p>The first observation is the image captured by the camera:</p>

        <img src="images\img1.png" alt="Image captured by the car's camera in a straight line">
        <img src="images\img2.png" alt="Image captured by the car's camera in a curve">
        <p>
            Since the rotational speed is 0 and constant, the car moves in a straight line and exits 
            the track at the first curve.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"> ðŸŽ¯ Line Detection</h2>
        <p>
            The first step to guiding the car along the line is to detect the reference line.
            To achieve this, I printed the <strong>RGB value</strong> of the central pixel from the first 
            iteration of the loop, which corresponds to a pixel in the line. The result obtained is 
            <strong>[41, 41, 207]</strong>.
        </p>

        <img src="images\img3.png" alt="Pixel (on green) from which the RGB value of the line to be followed is extracted">

        <p>
            With this value, I proceeded to calculate the <strong>mask</strong> that will be used later 
            as a reference for the control system.
            Although the value was obtained in <strong>RGB</strong>, it is preferable to use the 
            <strong>HSV</strong> color space because it separates color information from illumination, 
            allowing for a more stable detection under different lighting conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            To account for possible variations in the lineâ€™s tone, I defined a small range of Â±10, 
            which is then used to filter the pixels in the captured image to obtain the final mask.
        </p>
